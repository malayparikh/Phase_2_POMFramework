==========================Limitations with current script approach in selenium===============

1. Not able to put script with Organize manner
2. To many locators which we need to add into scripts and hard to remember
3. We do not have any reusability

Total 50 java pages or classes / methods

500 locators 

UI & Feature change request

100 locators - We need to locators manually, after we need to apply chanages in scrpts (one by one)

======================Page Factory============================

@FindBy(locatorname = "value")
WebElement element1;

@FindBy(xpath = "//input[@value="firstName"])
WebElement firstName;

======================================================



Web Applications : 

No. of pages : Many forms, text fields, dropdowns, UI fields : 10 Pages

1. Login Page : 

Username, password, forgot password, login button : 5 Locators on your page

2. Register Page : 6 text fields, 1 radio button, 1 checkbox, 1 button, 13 links : 22 locators on register page

Total we need to handle 30 locators for above pages 

Update on 15 locators ???? we need to revisit it

We have used in 15 test methods and we have used above locators
